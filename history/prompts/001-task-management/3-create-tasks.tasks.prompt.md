# Create Tasks

## User Input
```

```

## Response Summary
Generated a comprehensive set of implementation tasks for the Core Task Management System. The tasks are organized in 10 phases following the priority order of user stories from the specification. The tasks include setup, foundational components, all 6 user stories (from P1 to P3 priority), testing, and polish phases. Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths.

## Outcome
Successfully created the tasks file at `specs/001-task-management/tasks.md` with 81 individual tasks organized by phase and user story priority. The tasks cover the entire implementation from project setup to final validation and documentation.

## Evaluation
The tasks are well-structured according to the specification requirements, with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. Each user story is represented as a separate phase with independently testable criteria as defined in the feature specification.
