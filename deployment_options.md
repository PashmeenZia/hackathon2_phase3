There is no `.vercel` directory in the `frontend` folder. To deploy to Vercel, we need to either:

1.  Initialize Vercel in the `frontend` directory (this will involve interactive prompts).
2.  Deploy via Git integration (which would require committing and pushing changes).
3.  Provide an existing Vercel Project ID and Team ID for direct deployment.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
